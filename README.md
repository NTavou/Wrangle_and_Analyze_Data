- Used data munging techniques to gather, assess and clean the twitter data of **WeRateDogs** account. 

- Pandas, Requests, Tweepy and Seaborn were used to complete the project.
The report was generated in a Jupyter Notebook ---> wrangle_act.ipynb.

- Created a report that describes the wrangling part of the project ---> wrangle_report.pdf 

...and another one that communicates the insights and displays of the produced visualizations from the wrangled data ---> act_report.pdf
