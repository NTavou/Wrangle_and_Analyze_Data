* Used data munging techniques to gather, assess and clean the twitter data of WeRateDogs account. Created a report that describes the wrangling part of the project and another one that communicates the insights and displays of the produced visualizations from the wrangled data. (Python, pandas, Requests, Tweepy, seaborn, jupyter)
